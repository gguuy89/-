<h2> my illustration work  </h2>
<p>   Introducing my <h3>illustration work </h3>The first work is a child I <u>drew with the theme of autumn.</u>
I drew this work with the concept of a girl touching a sunflower when it receives sunlight, but the picture is a bit strange!!! Still, it's a lot of fun and it's a work that leaves a lingering impression that I want to draw again. The next work is:</p>

width="50%"

This work is a girl drawn with a Halloween concept. This girl is a girl with a job as a wizard, but at a party, a girl eating candy ate a forbidden magic and turned into a small toy!!!!</p>

I drew this work with the concept of the sea... <strong>This friend is a child of the sea, and one day,</strong> while <u>using his powers, he transforms into an archmage and a</u> spirit, and lives happily with the archmage!!!!</p>
